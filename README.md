# Ball Shooter

I made a simple ball shooter game using "RAYLIB" library in c++, in this we have 15 sec to shoot at fast pacing moving balls using crosshair (controlled by mouse) and we be awarded 1 point after each successful hit .

I have attached two pictures for reference purposes to help clarify the context of this project.

Made using C++ and RAYLIB library

## Deployment

To deploy this project run on your machine you will need

1)C++ with minGw compiler

2)Raylib library

[Watch this Tutorial on YouTube for minGW and Raylib](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPDLTQ4J_zQ&t=366s)




## Running using vscode

#### This will generate a exe file called "shooting_game".

```powershell in vscode
  g++ main.cpp -o shooting_game -lraylib -lopengl32 -lgdi32 -lwinmm
```

#### This below will run the executable file and open the game

```powershell in vscode
  ./shooting_game
```
